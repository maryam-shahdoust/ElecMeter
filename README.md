# ElecMeter : an index for Evaluating an Election social Dissatisfaction

</div>
<img src="schematic_fig3.drawio.png" style="width:80%;" align=center>

ElecMeter is an index for measuring voter dissatisfaction in single-winner elections. The core idea is to assign each voter a dissatisfaction score based on the rank position of the winning candidate (see Figure, part A). These individual scores are then aggregated into a distribution (see Figure, part B), which is compared against several benchmark distributions using the Jensen‚ÄìShannon divergence. The benchmarks represent **ideal**(all voters are fully satisfied with the outcome), **maximally dissatisfied**(all voters assign the winner the lowest possible rank), **neutral**(equal distribution across all dissatisfaction levels), and **polarized patterns**(concentrates mass at the extremes;fully satisfied and fully dissatisfied), reflecting theoretically meaningful extremes and transitional states of possible dissatisfaction distributions.
The ElecMeter Index combines the average voter dissatisfaction score with the most extreme divergence-based index through a generalized mean formulation (for details, see ElecMeter: An Index for Evaluating Electoral Social Dissatisfaction). This approach captures both the magnitude and the structural pattern of dissatisfaction within the electorate.

Below, you can see the dissatisfaction index computed by ElecMeter for two populations corresponding to the distributions shown in the figure above. ElecMeter is bounded within the unit interval [0,1]. This boundedness enhances interpretability, as the values have a clear absolute meaning: 0 corresponds to complete satisfaction, and 1 corresponds to complete dissatisfaction.

### An Example of Calculating the Dissaisfaction of the results of voting using ElecMeter Index:
Suppose there are two populations, each with a size of 10,000. In each population, an election is held separately to select a winner among five candidates. After the winner is chosen, the voters‚Äô dissatisfaction distributions can be represented as follows:
- Population A: (3197, 1247, 3773, 646, 1137)
- Population B: (3728, 3268, 0, 8, 2996)
The dissatisfaction index for these two populations is then calculated using the function ElecMeter_function(). For these two populatrions the indexes of the function are:
- size of the populations : population_size = 10000 
- observed_frequencies (for population A ) : observed_frequencies_A  = c(3197, 1247, 3773, 646, 1137) 
- observed_frequencies (for population A ) : observed_frequencies_B  = c(3728, 3268, 0, 8, 2996)
- number of candidates : number_candidates = 5 
- p = 3

``` bash
ElecMeter.popA <- ElecMeter_index(population_size, observed_frequencies_A, number_candidates,p)
ElecMeter.popB <- ElecMeter_index(population_size, observed_frequencies_B, number_candidates,p)
```
The outputs are as follows:
``` bash
> ElecMeter.popA

                     0.54653782                      0.70879003

              js_observed_ideal js_observed_max_dissatisfaction             js_observed_neutral 
                      0.4208865                       0.4938458                       0.2340600 
          js_observed_polarized                    Ideal_vs_Max                   Ideal_vs_Neut 
                      0.1888195                       0.4601199                       0.6426273 
                   Ideal_vs_pol                 Elecmeter_index 
                      0.6903106                       0.5772262
```
The results reveal that both populations have almost the same normalized average dissatisfaction (Avg_Dissatisfaction_norm ‚âà 0.382). However, their ElecMeter index values differ: 0.709 for Population A and 0.577 for Population B. Therefore, according to the ElecMeter index, **the population A is more dissatisfied than population B**. This difference reflects structural variations in dissatisfaction beyond the average.
According to the Jensen‚ÄìShannon divergence between the observed distributions and the benchmark distributions (js_observed_ideal), Population B is closer to the ideal distribution than Population A. Among the different dissatisfaction benchmarks, Population A is closest to the neutral distribution (js_observed_neutral = 0.0712), while Population B is closer to the polarized distribution (js_observed_polarized = 0.188).


## Dissatisfaction Distribution Simulation

This repository provides R code to simulate dissatisfaction distributions in ranking/voting scenarios with multiple candidates. The main function SimPopulation() generates dissatisfaction profiles for simulated populations under probabilistic models.

üìñ **Scenario:**

Imagine we have K candidates in an election (or ranking system). Every population produces rankings of candidates. Since different voting methods may yield different winners, we want to compute the dissatisfaction distribution for all possible winners.

Dissatisfaction of a candidate = distance of that candidate‚Äôs position from the top in a ranking (0 = first place, 1 = second place, ‚Ä¶).

By simulating multiple populations, we obtain the distribution of dissatisfaction levels under different possible outcomes.

‚öôÔ∏è **Methodology:**

The simulation follows these steps:

- **Generate all possible rankings (permutations):** For K candidates, there are K! permutations. For example, with K = 5, we get 120 permutations.
  ```bash
    # define candidates
  candidates <- LETTERS[1:number_candidates]
  # get the list of all permutations
  library(combinat)
  PP <- permn(candidates)
  PP <- matrix(unlist(PP),length(PP),length(candidates),byrow=T)
  PP <- PP[order(PP[,1], decreasing = FALSE),]
  ```
- **Simulate ranking frequencies per population:** Populations of size N are simulated using a multinomial distribution.
The probability vector for the multinomial is drawn from a Dirichlet distribution. The Dirichlet parameter(Œ±) is randomize. Each run uses a random Œ± chosen from {0.05, 0.01, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3}.
```bash
### Generate the number of permutations per sample : multinomial sample
require(dirmult)
require(HMP)
#in Multinomial code : The first number is the number of reads and the second is the number of subject
set.seed(100000)
freqs<-c()
for(i in 1:groups){
  nrs    <- population_size
  alpha <- sample(c(0.05,0.01,0.25,0.5,1,2,3),replace=FALSE,size=1,rep(0.15,7))
  #alpha  <- 1
  P      <- rdirichlet(1,rep(alpha,dim(PP)[1]))
  freqs  <- rbind(freqs,Multinomial(nrs,P))
      }

names <- cbind(sort(rep(LETTERS[1:number_candidates],times=dim(PP)[1]/number_candidates)),rep(1:(dim(PP)[1]/number_candidates),times=number_candidates))
colnames(freqs) <- paste(names[,1],names[,2])
rownames(freqs) <- c(paste("pop",1:groups,sep=''))

```
-  ***Calculate dissatisfaction scores:*** Each candidate is considered as the winner and for each permutation, dissatisfaction of a candidate is calculted as its rank position ‚àí 1.
``` bash
#Diss indicates the distance of each candidate to the top position in each permutation
Diss <- data.frame()
for ( i in 1:dim(PP)[1]){
for ( j in 1:length(candidates)){
      Diss[i,j] <- which(PP[i,]== candidates[j])-1
  }}

colnames(Diss) <- LETTERS[1:number_candidates]
# each column represents a winner candidate.
x    <- list()
info <- array(x,groups)

for ( i in 1:groups) {
  info[[i]]           <- cbind(freqs[i,],Diss[,1:length(candidates)])
  colnames(info[[i]]) <- c('freq',LETTERS[1:number_candidates])
}
```

- ***Assign winners & aggregate dissatisfaction:*** Dissatisfaction values are weighted by permutation frequencies. Dissatisfaction distributions are built by computing how often each dissatisfaction level (0 to K-1) appears for each candidate and each population.
``` bash
###Distribution of DisSatisfaction
dist <- array(0,c(number_candidates,number_candidates,groups))
colnames(dist) <- LETTERS[1:number_candidates]
rownames(dist) <- seq(0,number_candidates - 1)

for (i in 1:groups){
for (j in 1:length(candidates)) {
  dist[,j,i] <- aggregate(.~info[[i]][,j+1],data=info[[i]][,c(1,j+1)],FUN=sum)[,2]
    }
}
sim_results <- list(candidates,PP,freqs,info,Diss,dist)
```


***üöÄ Usage:*** This generates dissatisfaction distributions for: 5 candidates, across one populations with 1000 individuals.
``` bash
results <- SimPopulation(number_candidates = 5,
                         groups = 1,
                        population_size = 1000)
```
The final dissatisfaction distributions are like this:
    A   B   C   D   E
0 185 181 199 210 225
1 172 194 242 205 187
2 204 184 181 216 215
3 251 223 185 173 168
4 188 218 193 196 205


***üìä Outputs:***

The function returns a list with:

candidates ‚Üí Candidate labels.

PP ‚Üí All candidate permutations.

freqs ‚Üí Frequencies of permutations per population.

info ‚Üí Dissatisfaction values and frequencies per population.

Diss ‚Üí Dissatisfaction scores for each candidate in each permutation.

dist ‚Üí Final dissatisfaction distributions (per candidate, per population).
